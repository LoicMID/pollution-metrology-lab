# pollution-metrology-lab
Methodological framework for low-cost sensor calibration and air quality monitoring. Public repository developed as part of a PhD research on signal processing and machine learning for environmental metrology.

🌍 Environmental Sensor Reliability Framework
🎓 Context & Disclaimer
This repository serves as the public experimental framework for my PhD research: "Development of a methodological framework for the reliability of air pollution sensor networks".

⚠️ Important Note: This project demonstrates the methodologies and algorithms developed during the thesis (calibration strategies, uncertainty quantification, signal processing).

No confidential industrial data is hosted here.

All demonstrations use open datasets (e.g., UCI Air Quality, Synthetic Data) or simulated environments. * This is a "sandbox" for validating generic approaches before applying them to real-world sensor networks.
